                    <h4>Caselles-Dupré</h4>
                    <li>AI could not be viewed as a mass-produced alternative to human artists and also should not replace art made by humans (Golger 2019).</li>
                    <h4>Jonathan Jones</h4>
                    <li>Edmond de Belamy cannot be considered as artwork since AI need to replicate human consciousness to create artwork, not understanding the arts as humans do(Carballo-Calero, 2023).</li>
                    <li>Portrait of Edmond Belamy does not have the same ability to express human awareness because it was created entirely by an algorithm and does not reflect the individual expression of a human artist(Staeudtner 2019).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Buying AI created art is not a reasonable move</li>
                    <li>AI created artwork can not represent artist’s talent, their heart of creating an artwork and the effort they put in</li>
                    <li>The high transaction price support AI creative art is art in another way</li>
                    <li>Whether we support or not, the future generation is dominated by AI</li>
